Example 1 is sound, example 2 is UB.

`v.as_mut_pointer()` refers to `Vec::as_mut_ptr(v)`, which only creates a `&mut` reference to the vec itself.

`v.get_unchecked_mut()` comes from an implicit dereference to a slice, referring to `<[T]>::get_unchecked_mut(Vec::deref(v))`, creating a `&mut` to all slice elements.
When doing the deref for creating `r2`, this full `&mut` invalidates `r1`.
