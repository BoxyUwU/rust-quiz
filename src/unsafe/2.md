Even though all *initialized* bitpatterns are valid for integer types, creating an integer value from uninitialized memory is still undefined behavior. More details can be found in the [`MaybeUninit` documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/union.MaybeUninit.html).

Careful readers may also have noticed that there is an index out of bounds error from checking `random_number <= 100` instead of `random_number < 100`. While this is logically incorrect, it does not result in any UB as the previous line when creating `random_number` is UB and thus all future lines are not executed.
