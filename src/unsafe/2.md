Even though all bitpatterns are valid for a `u16` (and all integer types in general), creating an integer value from uninitialized memory is still undefined behavior. Since uninitialized memory does not have a fixed value, it cannot be used to generate an integer, which are for fixed bit patterns. More details can be found in the [`MaybeUnint` documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/union.MaybeUninit.html).
