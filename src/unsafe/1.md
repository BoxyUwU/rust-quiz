Examples 1 and 2 are fine, while 3 and 4 are UB:

```
error: Undefined Behavior: memory access failed: null pointer is a dangling pointer (it has no provenance)

```

Loading a value from a null pointer is undefined behavior in Rust.
However, dereferencing a pointer does not always cause a load.

In examples 1 and 2 dereference produces a place which is immediately discarded by the assignment to `_` (note that parenthesis do not affect anything other than precedence of operators).

In examples 3 and 4 the place created by the dereference is coerced to a value, because it is returned from a block (note that normal and `unsafe` blocks behave the same) which causes UB.
