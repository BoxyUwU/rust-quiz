```rust

```

For each `println!`, say what it will print or that it won't compile.

Only `A::Two as usize` doesn't compile:

```
{{#include ../../code/examples/stderr/misc_10.stderr}}
```

Subtituting the non-compiling line with a dummy print will output something like the following:
```
0
98926091234224
doesn't compile
0
1
2
```

There are multiple potentially suprising things:

1. You can `as`-cast an enum with non-unit variants to get its discriminant, [as long as it's fieldless](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/enumerations.html#r-items.enum.discriminant.coercion.fieldless).

2. `A::One as usize` gives you the *address of the constructor function of `A::One`*, and not `A::One`'s discriminant (the latter can be gotten via `A::One() as usize`).

3. Unit and tuple variants can be constructed with `{}` syntax. This is similar to how unit and tuple structures can also be created with `{}`.
