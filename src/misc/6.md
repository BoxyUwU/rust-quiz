When structs/tuples/arrays are dropped, they drop their constituent parts (e.g. fields, tuple elements, array elements) from first to last.

On the other hand, when exiting a scope in a function body, locals and temporaries are dropped in *reverse definition order*.
In other words, temporaries/locals are dropped in order of youngest to oldest.

In `fn owo` there is a fully constructed value of type `(PrintOnDrop, PrintOnDrop, PrintOnDrop)`.
When exiting the function the tuple is dropped as a whole, dropping its first element, then second, and finally its third.

In `fn uwu` there is never a fully constructed tuple type, instead there are three *temporaries* of type `PrintOnDrop` on the stack.
When exiting the function the temporaries on the stack are dropped in reverse definition order, starting from the most recently created, `PrintOnDrop("3")`, to oldest created, `PrintOnDrop("1")`.
