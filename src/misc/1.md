# Miscellaneous 1

The idea for this question was suggested by [`@orlp`](https://github.com/orlp/).

What does this program print?

```rust
struct PrintOnDrop(&'static str);
impl Drop for PrintOnDrop {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        print!("{}", self.0);
    }
}

fn main() {
    owo();
    uwu();
}

fn owo() {
    ((PrintOnDrop("1"), PrintOnDrop("2"), PrintOnDrop("3")), return);
}

fn uwu() {
    (PrintOnDrop("1"), PrintOnDrop("2"), PrintOnDrop("3"), return);
}
```

Every expression in the outermost tuple is evaluated from left to right.
`return` is the last expression, at which point the function returns and all tuple elements are dropped.
When an expression during tuple construction causes drops to be invoked, all elements are dropped from last to first.
This is a general rule for local variables or temporaries in Rust and also applies to local variables.

But in `owo`, the first element is a fully constructed tuple, which is dropped the same way all structures are - from first to last.
