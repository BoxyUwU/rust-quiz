As the error says, there is a given order function qualifiers must go in.

Careful readers may also have noticed that the size of `[*mut u32; 64]` is not necessarily equal to `[u8; 256]`. On 64bit platforms the array of pointers would be `512` bytes large, `8 bytes * 64 elements = 512 bytes`. While this is a logical error and would result in a panic at runtime, the code can never be executed due to the compilation error.
