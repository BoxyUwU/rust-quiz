Types and values live in separate namespaces as it is usually possible to syntactically determine whether an identifier should be for a value or type.

This means that `struct bar {}` is part of the type namespace, whereas `fn bar` is part of the value namespace (as functions in Rust are first
class values).
This allows for both of these declarations to co-exist.

However, `const foo` and `fn foo` are both part of the value namespace, causing a compiler error.
