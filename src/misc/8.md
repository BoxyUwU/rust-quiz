There are 3 kinds of structs in rust:

1. Plain structs (eg `struct Foo{bar: i32}`)
2. Tuple structs (eg `struct Bar(i32);`)
3. Unit structs (eg `struct Baz;`)

However all 3 kinds can have a struct with no fields.

Types and values live in seperate namespaces, as it is usually [^not1] possible to
syntacticly determine weather an identifier the compiller needs to resolve will
be an value or type .

[^not1]: except when it isn't :)

This means that `struct bar` only gets inserted into the type namespace, and `fn
bar` only gets inserted to the value namespace (as functions in rust are first
class values [^not]). Therefor both of these declarations can co-exist.

However for `struct foo`, because it's a tuple struct, it also needs to insert
the constructor into the value namespace. (This isn't quite the same as
inserting a function, as it's also valid in patern matching, but it's close).
This then clashes with `fn foo`, which also lives in the value namespace,
causing the compiller error.

[^not] except when they're not :)
