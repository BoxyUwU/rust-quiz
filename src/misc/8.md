There are 3 kinds of structs in Rust:

1. Plain structs (eg `struct Foo { bar: i32 }`)
2. Tuple structs (eg `struct Bar(i32);`)
3. Unit structs (eg `struct Baz;`)

All 3 kinds can have a struct with no fields.

Types and values live in separate namespaces, as it is usually [^not1] possible to syntactically determine whether an identifier the compiler needs to resolve will be an value or type .

[^not1]: except when it isn't :)

This means that `struct bar {}` only gets inserted into the type namespace, and `fn bar` only gets inserted to the value namespace (as functions in Rust are first
class values [^not]).
Therefore both of these declarations can co-exist.

However for `struct foo`, because it's a tuple struct, it also needs to insert the constructor into the value namespace. (This isn't quite the same as inserting a function, as it's also valid in pattern matching, but it's close).
This then clashes with `fn foo`, which also lives in the value namespace, causing the compiler error.

[^not] except when they're not :)
