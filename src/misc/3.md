There is a syntactic difference between a *method* call and a normal call. `expr.identifier()` is always a method call and `Foo` does not have a method called `func`. To call the function stored in a field you need to add parenthesis:
```rust
fn bar(foo: Foo) {
    (foo.func)();
}
```

Note that the same problem does not apply to tuples and tuple structs, because you can't name a method with an integer identifier. i.e. the following would compile:

```rust
struct Foo(fn());

fn print_heheh() {
    println!("ferrisUwu")
}

fn main() {
    let foo = Foo(print_heheh);
    foo.0();
}
```
