No matter what kind a struct is, it can always be initialized with braces (even if not declared with them). Therefore the first 3 statements are OK.

Only `Tuple` structs can be initialized with parentheses, because it's actually calling a constructor function.

`Unit;` on it's own is fine, because `Unit` is declared as a unit struct, so `Unit` is a constant of type `Unit`.

`Tuple;` on it's own is fine, because `Tuple` as a value is the constructor for `Tuple`, with type `fn() -> Tuple`.

`Struct;` is a compiler error, because `Struct` only exists as a type, and never a value.

Destructuring assignment on a unit structs works as any other struct, 
and struct update syntax as well, even when there are no fields.
