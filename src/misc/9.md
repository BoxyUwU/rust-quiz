No matter what kind a struct is, it can always be initialized with braces (even if not declared with them). Therefor the first 3 statements are OK.

Destructuring assignment on a unit structs works as any other struct, and struct update syntax as well, even when there are no fields.

`A;` on it's own is fine, because `A` is declared as a unit struct, so `A` is a constant of type `A`.

`B;` on it's own is fine, because `B` as a value is the constructor for `B`, with type `fn() -> B`.

`C;` is a compiler error, because `C` only exists as a type, and never a value.
