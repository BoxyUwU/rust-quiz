`Unit;` on it's own is fine, because `Unit` is declared as a unit struct, so `Unit` is a constant of type `Unit`.

`Tuple;` on it's own is fine, because `Tuple` as a value is the constructor for `Tuple`, with type `fn() -> Tuple`.

`Struct;` is a compiler error, because `Struct` only exists as a type, and never a value.

Only `Tuple` structs can be initialized with parentheses, because it's actually calling a constructor function.

No matter what kind a struct is, it can always be initialized with braces (even if not declared with them). Therefore all 3 statements are OK.

You cannot generally use a struct name as the left hand side of an assignment. 
However, with the `Unit = Unit` works because this is a destructuring assignment where
`Unit` on the left is a constant pattern.

Destructuring assignment on a unit structs works as any other struct, 
and struct update syntax as well, even when there are no fields. 
Therefore, the last three statements work.
