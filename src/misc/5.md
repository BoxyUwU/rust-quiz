This diagnostic is fairly confusing. The diagnostic assumes that you meant to use `Sub` as a type, not a trait, which requires the `dyn` keyword. Though, in this specific case this assumption doesn't make sense as `Sub` is not dyn compatible.

The compilation error is caused by being unable to refer to items from super traits through sub traits.
Even though `Sub` has a super trait `Super`, you can't use `Sub::assoc()`.

You *can* use `Super::assoc()` though, for example this compiles just fine:

```rust
trait Super {
    fn assoc() -> Self;
}

trait Sub: Super {}

fn f<T: Sub>() -> T {
    Super::assoc()
}
```

`Trait::assoc` is a shorter version of `<_ as Trait>::assoc` (aka [fully qualified path](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/paths.html#qualified-paths)).
