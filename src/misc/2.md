There is a lot of fluff, the mistake is on the second to last line.
`dbg!` returns its argument after printing to the `stderr`, which means that you need to use `;` after it in cases like this.

<!-- 
FIXME: should we remove *some* fluff?
       reading long examples is not very fun.
       IMO having fluff here is important to make this hard,
       but maybe we don't need that much.

       I was thinking of maybe using `.for_each(|item| dbg!(item))` and iterators instead of this.
