Yeah. This actually runs. 

(:

The compiler does not check "Well Formedness" of traits in trait objects, so `dyn Trait<[u8]>` does not produce an error, even though `[u8]` is **not** `Sized`.

This is might be unsound, but no one come up with an example of causing UB in safe code with this.
At the very least, this is unexpected.
