The `impl`s are turned into generic parameters on the function (`O` for the outer `impl A`, `I` for the inner `impl B`).

```rust
fn f<O, I>(_: O)
where
    O: for<'a> A<'a, Assoc = I>,
    I: B + 'a,
{}
```

When looked at like this, it can be seen that the `'a` in `I: B + 'a` doesn't actually exist.
It is supposed to come from the `O: for<'a>` bound, but that's a separate bound.
So the `I` bound cannot name `'a`, which is why this does not compile.

This is why nested argument-position-impl-trait can sometimes inhibit confusing behavior.
