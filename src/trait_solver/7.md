   = note: due to object lifetime defaults, `Box<dyn Cat>` actually means `Box<(dyn Cat + 'static)>`

error: could not compile `code` (example "types_1") due to 1 previous error
```

`Box<dyn Cat>` means `Box<dyn Cat + 'static>`, and the local variable is not `'static`. `&0` *does* produce a `&'static i32` though, because it is implicitly static-promoted.
