Let's first explicitly annotate all elided lifetimes:

```rust
fn func<'a>(a: &'a u32) {
    dbg!(a);
}

fn accepts_func<'a>(b: for<'b> fn(&'b u32), c: &'a u32) {
    b(c);
}

fn main() {
    accepts_func(func as fn(_), &23);
}
```

`func` is a higher-ranked function of type `for<'a> fn(&'a u32)`. This means it can accept *any* lifetime.
`accepts_func`'s first parameter `b` is also a higher ranked function of the same type, so it needs a function that can accept any lifetime.

But in `main`, we cast the higher-ranked function type to `fn(_)`. `fn(_)` is inferred to *not* be a higher-ranked function pointer type
(inferring a *specific* lifetime for the argument), so it is no longer valid to pass to `accepts_func`.

If we instead specify it as `as fn(&_)` it gets inferred as a higher-ranked function pointer type again and the program compiles.
Specifying an inferred type as `&_` is sometimes done in real programs for closure arguments to make sure the closure type is inferred to be higher-ranked.
