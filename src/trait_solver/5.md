In order for these impls to overlap the type `()` must implement `Sub<T>` for some type `T`, the `Sub` trait is public so in theory some downstream crate could implement `(): Sub<Local>`. However, the supertrait `Super` cannot be implement for the type `()` by any downstream crates as `impl Super for () {` would not pass the orphan check in downstream crates 

If we were to introduce an `impl Super for () {` to this example then coherence would forbid this code.
