This is the unfair Rust quiz, a collection of extremely hard and sometimes even unfair questions about Rust, made by the gayest people you know.

The canonical URL of this quiz is <https://this.quiz.is.fckn.gay>

<!-- Keep it in sync with rust-toolchain.toml! -->
> The code examples were tested with nightly-2025-11-02, but it is intended that they work
> on any future Rust version too.
