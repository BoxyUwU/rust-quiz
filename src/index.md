# Introduction

This is the unfair Rust quiz, a collection of extremely hard and sometimes even unfair questions about Rust, made by the gayest people you know.

This quiz is split into multiple sections where each section covers a different topic or style of question. Each section has its own introduction page that describes what the section is about, how to go about answering questions in it.

Currently there are four sections:
- Unsafe
- Miscellaneous
- Trait Solver
- Borrow Checker

The canonical URL of this quiz is <https://this.quiz.is.fckn.gay>

You can find the repo at <https://github.com/BoxyUwU/rust-quiz>

<!-- Keep it in sync with rust-toolchain.toml! -->
> The code examples were tested with nightly-2026-01-04, but it is intended that they work
> on any future Rust version too.
