`mutate` forces the lifetime of the reference to be the same as the lifetime of the `foo` itself, so you effectively can't use it ever again â€” any reference will overlap with the one passed to `mutate`.

To fix this you need to detach the lifetime of the reference from `Foo`'s lifetime:
```rust
fn mutate<'a, 'b>(f: &'a mut Foo<'b>) { ... }
```

Alternatively you can elide both lifetimes:
```rust
fn mutate(f: &mut Foo<'_>) { ... }
```
