This error is the limitation of the current borrow checker.
Because `v` is returned from the function, the lifetime of the reference returned from the first `get_mut` is inferred to be "until the end of the function". The current borrow checker does not understand that the `None` variant does not contain the lifetime, so after the `if` the reference does not need to be kept alive (there is no reference).

This is a very famous example which is fixed by the next implementation of the borrow checker, [polonius](https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius).
