The closure assigned to `b` can only return a reference with one specific lifetime (because it has no lifetimes in arguments).
So both calls to `b` return a unique (mutable) reference with the same lifetime, which is an error, because all unique references must be disjoint.

If you inline calls to `b` it *would* work though:

```rust
fn foo(a: &mut u32) -> u32 {
    let mut b = || &mut *a;

    *(&mut *a) = 12;
    *(&mut *a) = 73;
    *a
}
```

This is fine because reborrows return different lifetimes, allowing them to be disjoint.
