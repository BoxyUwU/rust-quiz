`r2_twice` does not compile because `R2` does not implement `Copy`, and is moved twice.
However, `r1_twice` *does* compile even though `&mut i32` does *not* implement `Copy`!

This is because, for `R1`, the reference is not moved into `r1_once`, instead it's *reborrowed*.
Reborrows are a special operation on references that the borrow checker understands and behave like `&mut *x`.
So there is a new reference passed to `r1_once`, with the original borrow having been preserved.
