Elided lifetimes in function pointers use "for all", so `fn(&u32)` in `accepts_func` is the same as `for<'a> fn(&'a u32)`.
In other words `accepts_func` requires a function that can be called with a reference with any lifetime.

Notably `func` can't be called with any lifetime â€” it can only be called with `'static`,
causing the error.

Note that normally it's okay to shorten lifetimes, i.e. coerce `&'big _` to `&'small _`.
However, in function pointers it's different, you can coerce `fn(&'small _)` to `fn(&'big _)` but not the other way around.
This is because when you call `fn(&'big _)` the argument can be coerced to `&'small _`.
This is also commonly known as functions being **contravariant** in respect to their arguments.
You can learn more about variance in the [Subtyping and Variance] chapter of the nomicon.
