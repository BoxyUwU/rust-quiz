# Borrow Checker

For each code example on each page, when running `cargo run` what does the example output.
This may be a compiler error, a runtime panic, some kind of runtime logging, etc.

When the example is a compiler error, explain which operation errors and why.

When the example is a runtime panic, explain which part panics and why.

When the example runs successfully, explain why it does so and what it outputs.
