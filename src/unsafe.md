# Unsafe

This category contains questions about unsafe code and undefined behavior.
For every code snippet, the question is whether the code, as executed, is UB or whether it is sound.
When the snippet has UB, explain exactly *where* it is UB and why.

<!--
If you want categories of bugs, you should try to get a data race caused by a speculative read/write and you should try to get an algorithm that offsets a pointer too far on the last iteration but doesn't use it
