error[E0597]: `local` does not live long enough
  --> examples/trait_solver_7.rs:11:13

10 |     let local = 0;
   |         ----- binding `local` declared here
11 |     let r = &local;
   |             ^^^^^^ borrowed value does not live long enough

   |                 ----------- cast requires that `local` is borrowed for `'static`
13 | }
   | - `local` dropped here while still borrowed
   |
   = note: due to object lifetime defaults, `Box<dyn Cat>` actually means `Box<(dyn Cat + 'static)>`
